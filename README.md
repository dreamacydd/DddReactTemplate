# One React, hold the onions!

This is a React app created from the ground up, without resorting to the
use of Create-React-App.

The work here is largely based on that of Meg Shulmister over at
[JavaScript in Plain English][mshulminster].  I took Meg's work and
tweaked it for TypeScript support because TypeScript rocks my socks.
